/**
 * This abstract superclass defines the role of a function that wraps itself
 * around (or "decorates") another function.
 *
 * The signature of function methods in this hierarchy is "double f(double time)".
 * Each class defines this function in a way that is consistent with the class
 * name.
 *
 * The "time" argument is a value from 0 to 1 that represents a normalized
 * notion of time. For example, in the arc of a parabola, time goes 0 to 1 as x
 * goes 0 to the base of the arc and y goes 0 to the apogee (at t = .5) and back
 * to 0.
