/**
 * A WrapFilter object compresses whitespace and wraps text at a specified
 * width, optionally centering it. The class constructor requires a
 * BufferedWriter object and the line width. A typical filter class will accept
 * any Writer object in its constructor. The WrapFilter class requires a
 * BufferedWriter object because it requires the ability to write newlines in a
 * platform- independent way, and BufferedWriter supplies this ability.
 * <p>
 * The WrapFilter class expects line break indicators to appear as newline
 * characters. One way to arrange for this is to read input with a
 * BufferedReader object that handles platform differences in how line breaks
 * are indicated.
